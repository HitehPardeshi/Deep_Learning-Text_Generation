## Requirements

To install the required dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies:
- TensorFlow (Keras) / PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter (Optional: For notebook exploration)

## Usage

### 1. Prepare the Dataset
Place your text dataset in the `data/` folder. The dataset can be any text file, such as a novel, blog articles, or even song lyrics.

### 2. Train the Model

To train the RNN model on your dataset, run the following command:

```bash
python src/train.py --data_path data/your_dataset.txt --epochs 50 --batch_size 64
```

Arguments:
- `--data_path`: Path to the dataset file
- `--epochs`: Number of epochs for training
- `--batch_size`: Size of each batch for training

### 3. Generate Text

After training, you can generate text based on the trained model by running:

```bash
python src/generate.py --model_path models/trained_model.h5 --seed_text "Once upon a time"
```

The `--seed_text` is the initial text to kick-start the text generation.

## Model Architecture

The RNN-based text generation model consists of:
- An Embedding Layer to convert input text into dense vectors
- A stack of LSTM layers for sequence learning
- A Dense Layer to map the output back to the vocabulary size

**Model Overview:**

```text
Input --> Embedding Layer --> LSTM Layers --> Dense Layer --> Output
```

---

## Training

During training, the RNN is trained on sequences of text and learns to predict the next character or word in a sequence. The model is optimized using a categorical cross-entropy loss function, and backpropagation through time (BPTT) is used to update the weights.

## Results

After training for several epochs, the model is able to generate coherent text based on the input seed. Here’s an example of the generated text after training on a dataset of Shakespeare plays:

**Input Seed:** "To be, or not to be, that is the question"

**Generated Text:**
```text
To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
```
